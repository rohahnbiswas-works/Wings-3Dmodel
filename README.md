# Wings-3Dmodel
This repository contains 3D designs of wings which I had created for a micro class aircraft as an iteration. Unfortunately I have lost the Solidworks files of the other parts of the plane and am just left with this :'(. This was created by me as a member of a special team: Team Aviators International of which I also became the Aerodynamics Lead.
If one wants to view the model and its parts then one needs the solidworks software, he/she can then download the files and view it. Otherwise I have provided I quick glimpse of the model in the Images section.
