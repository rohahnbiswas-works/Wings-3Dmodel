# Wings-3Dmodel
This repository contains 3D designs of wings which I had created for a micro class aircraft as an iteration. Unfortunately I have lost the Solidworks files of the other parts of the plane and am just left with this :'(. This was created by me as a member of a special team: Team Aviators International of which I also became the Aerodynamics Lead.
